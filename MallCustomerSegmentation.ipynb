    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data science student, I aim to apply unsupervised learning to segment mall customers based on their demographic and behavioral data. This project uses the Mall Customer Segmentation Data from Kaggle to identify distinct customer groups, which can help mall management tailor marketing strategies. My approach includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering with unsupervised learning models, and hyperparameter optimization to ensure robust results. This notebook documents my process, from data collection to model evaluation, addressing the project rubric's requirements."

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected the \"Mall Customer Segmentation Data\" from Kaggle, a publicly available dataset ideal for clustering tasks. It contains 200 records with features: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (in thousands of dollars), and Spending Score (1-100). The data is clean, with no missing values, and sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). I downloaded the CSV file and placed it in my working directory. My goal is to use this data to segment customers without predefined labels, making it suitable for unsupervised learning.\n"

    "\n",
    "The output from `data.head()` shows the first five rows of the dataset, confirming the presence of five columns: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100). The `data.info()` output verifies that there are 200 entries with no missing values, as all columns have 200 non-null entries. The data types are appropriate: `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, and `Spending Score (1-100)` are integers, while `Gender` is an object (string). The `data.describe()` output provides summary statistics, revealing that Age ranges from 18 to 70 (mean ~39), Annual Income from 15k to 137k (mean ~60.56k), and Spending Score from 1 to 99 (mean ~50.2). The standard deviations (e.g., ~26.26k for income, ~25.82 for spending score) suggest moderate variability, but the maximum income (137k) is notably higher than the 75th percentile (78k), hinting at potential outliers to explore later. This confirms the dataset is clean and suitable for clustering, with numerical features ready for scaling due to their differing ranges."

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to segment mall customers into meaningful groups based on their Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score, using unsupervised learning. Since the dataset has no target variable, clustering is appropriate. I hypothesize that customers can be grouped by spending behavior and demographics, which can inform targeted marketing. I'll use K-means clustering as my primary unsupervised model due to its simplicity and effectiveness for numerical data, and DBSCAN to explore density-based clustering, comparing their performance to meet the rubric's requirement for multiple models.\n",

I'll rename columns for clarity (e.g., \"Annual Income (k$)\" to \"Annual_Income\") and check for outliers using summary statistics. This step ensures the data is ready for visualization and modeling, addressing the rubric's 26-point EDA requirement."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data science student, I aim to apply unsupervised learning to segment mall customers based on their demographic and behavioral data. This project uses the Mall Customer Segmentation Data from Kaggle to identify distinct customer groups, which can help mall management tailor marketing strategies. My approach includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering with unsupervised learning models, and hyperparameter optimization to ensure robust results. This notebook documents my process, from data collection to model evaluation, addressing the project rubric's requirements."

    "I selected the \"Mall Customer Segmentation Data\" from Kaggle, a publicly available dataset ideal for clustering tasks. It contains 200 records with features: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (in thousands of dollars), and Spending Score (1-100). The data is clean, with no missing values, and sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). I downloaded the CSV file and placed it in my working directory. My goal is to use this data to segment customers without predefined labels, making it suitable for unsupervised learning.\n"

The data types are appropriate: `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, and `Spending Score (1-100)` are integers, while `Gender` is an object (string). The `data.describe()` output provides summary statistics, revealing that Age ranges from 18 to 70 (mean ~39), Annual Income from 15k to 137k (mean ~60.56k), and Spending Score from 1 to 99 (mean ~50.2). The standard deviations (e.g., ~26.26k for income, ~25.82 for spending score) suggest moderate variability, but the maximum income (137k) is notably higher than the 75th percentile (78k), hinting at potential outliers to explore later.

The `describe()` output mirrors the earlier summary statistics, showing Age (18-70, mean ~38.85), Annual_Income (15-137k, mean ~60.56k), and Spending_Score (1-99, mean ~50.2). The wide range in Annual_Income (std ~26.26k) and the high maximum (137k) suggest potential outliers, which I’ll investigate via visualization.

Annual_Income has a multimodal distribution, with peaks around 20-40k, 60-80k, and a smaller group above 100k, suggesting diverse income groups and possible outliers at the high end (e.g., 137k). Spending_Score appears roughly uniform, with slight peaks at the extremes (low and high scores), indicating varied spending behaviors. The Gender count plot shows a slightly higher number of female customers than males, suggesting a balanced but slightly female-skewed customer base. The box plots  confirm no extreme outliers for Age or Spending_Score, as no points lie beyond the whiskers. However, Annual_Income has a few points above the upper whisker (~100k), indicating mild outliers (e.g., ~137k). These findings suggest scaling is necessary due to different ranges and that outliers in income may represent valid high-earning customers, so I’ll retain them.

The correlation between Annual_Income and Spending_Score is very weak (0.0099), indicating little linear relationship, which is surprising as I expected higher income to correlate with higher spending. The correlation between Age and Annual_Income is also negligible (-0.0124), suggesting these features are largely independent. These weak correlations are favorable for clustering, as K-means assumes feature independence, reducing the need for feature selection or transformation. However, the moderate Age-Spending_Score correlation suggests clusters may separate based on age-related spending patterns. I’ll proceed with all three numerical features for clustering, as they provide distinct information, and qualitatively assess Gender’s role later."

The clusters appear well-separated, with distinct groups: one with high income and high spending, another with low income and low spending, and others varying by age and spending behavior. For example, a cluster likely includes younger customers with moderate income but high spending scores, while another may include older customers with average income and lower spending. These segments suggest meaningful customer groups, such as “young high-spenders” or “conservative older shoppers,” which could inform targeted marketing (e.g., luxury promotions for high-income, high-spending groups).

The clusters are more fragmented than K-means, with smaller, denser groups and some points marked as noise, suggesting DBSCAN identifies fine-grained segments and outliers (e.g., customers with unique income-spending profiles). Compared to K-means, DBSCAN’s clusters are less uniform, which may reflect real density-based patterns but could complicate marketing applications due to the high number of clusters and noise points.

The DBSCAN silhouette score is higher at 0.5144 (calculated for non-noise points), suggesting that its clusters, when excluding outliers, are more tightly grouped and better separated than K-means clusters. This aligns with DBSCAN’s ability to form dense, well-defined clusters, though its 10 clusters and noise points make it less interpretable for broad marketing strategies compared to K-means’ 5 clear segments. K-means’ lower score may reflect its assumption of spherical clusters, which may not perfectly fit the data’s natural structure, whereas DBSCAN’s density-based approach better captures irregular cluster shapes. However, DBSCAN’s noise points and higher cluster count could complicate practical applications, and its performance depends heavily on parameter tuning. K-means is thus more suitable for general customer segmentation, while DBSCAN excels at identifying outliers and dense subgroups. Limitations include K-means’ sensitivity to initial centroids and DBSCAN’s sensitivity to `eps` and `min_samples`, suggesting future exploration of hierarchical clustering for robustness."

    "The K-means cluster characteristics reveal five distinct customer segments. Cluster 0 (54 customers) includes young customers (mean age ~ 25) with low-to-moderate income (~ 41k) but relatively high spending scores (~ 62), ideal for trendy, budget-friendly promotions. Cluster 1 (47 customers) comprises older customers (mean age ~ 56) with average income (~ 54k) and spending (~ 49), suggesting conservative shoppers who may respond to loyalty programs. Cluster 2 (40 customers) represents affluent, high-spending customers (mean income ~ 86k, spending ~ 82, age ~ 33), perfect for luxury or premium marketing. Cluster 3 (20 customers) includes middle-aged customers (mean age ~ 46) with low income (~ 27k) and very low spending (~ 18), likely budget-conscious shoppers needing discount-driven campaigns. Cluster 4 (39 customers) has high-income (~ 86k) but low-spending (~ 19) customers (mean age ~ 40), indicating potential for targeted campaigns to boost spending (e.g., exclusive offers). The successful save to `segmented_customers.csv` ensures my results are preserved for sharing. These segments enable tailored marketing, but K-means’ spherical cluster assumption and DBSCAN’s parameter sensitivity are limitations. Future work could include hierarchical clustering or adding features like purchase frequency to refine segments.\n",
